## üåü How to run
 - ### Install all the requirements
    Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements.
 - ### Setup a Virtual Enviroment

   - Run this command in your terminal `python -m venv myenv`.
   - Change your directory by `cd myenv/Scripts` if on windows.
   - Activate the virtual enviroment by running this command `source activate`.
   - Move out from virtual env to your **Project Directory** by `cd..` .
   - Install the packages if not present - `uvicorn`, `fastapi`, `fitz`, `frontend`, `tools`, `opencv-python`, `pillow`, `python-multipart`, `PyMuPDF`.
   ```
